# NASTYA — Multi-Role AI Assistant Architecture

## Overview
NASTYA is a production-ready AI assistant built with a multi-role, multi-mode cognitive architecture.  
The project focuses on behavior design, dialog logic, and real-world application, not just prompt writing.

The assistant is actively used in business, education, and mentoring scenarios.

---

## Core Idea
Instead of generating isolated responses, NASTYA is designed as an intelligent partner that:
- adapts to user context
- switches roles intentionally
- asks clarifying questions when data is missing
- maintains long-term logic consistency

---

## Architecture

### 1. Role System
The assistant operates through clearly defined roles:
- Strategist
- Methodologist
- Producer
- Marketer
- Mentor
- Psychologically supportive assistant
- Analyst

Role switching is context-driven, not random.

---

### 2. Thinking Modes
Each response is generated using an explicit mode:
- Expert mode — structured, precise answers
- Support mode — emotional stabilization + clarity
- Strategic mode — long-term planning
- Teaching mode — step-by-step explanations
- Critical mode — gap and risk detection

---

### 3. Context Handling
- Maintains conversation goals
- Avoids contradictory advice
- Builds responses based on previous decisions
- Requests missing input before giving recommendations

---

### 4. Dialogue Logic
- Scenario-based prompting
- Intent detection
- Adaptive response depth
- Explicit constraints to prevent hallucinations

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case 1 — Business Strategy
User provides an unstructured idea →  
Assistant:
- structures the problem
- clarifies the goal
- proposes a strategy
- delivers a step-by-step action plan

---

### Case 2 — Emotional Burnout
User enters in a stressed or chaotic state →  
Assistant:
- switches to support mode
- stabilizes emotional state
- gradually transitions to action planning

---

### Case 3 — AI Assistant Creation
User wants to build a new AI assistant →  
Assistant:
- helps define the role
- target audience
- behavior rules
- monetization logic
